<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Desiree Jones. I am currently a registered nurse, going into my fourth year. I currently work in the intensive 
  care unit but looking to transition into the tech world. Nursing is something I haven't been passionate about for a
   while now and I've recently been looking into transitioning into something that excites me. After countless research I 
   discovered web development and decided to dive into this endeavor and have yet to be disappointed. Its allowed me to be 
   creative and I'm constantly learning something new everyday. </p>

<p>My current plan is to self teach as much as possible and then enroll into school as a computer science major and 
  pursue a post-bacc degree. I'm currently comfortable with HTML and CSS, and will be moving on to javascript soon. Learning
  languages challenges me in a way that I actually enjoy. Like nursing the tech world is so diverse and expansive, and I love 
  that. 
</p>

<p>I have experience with electronic medical record systems, like Cerner, Epic, and Meditech and knowing that I could transition 
  over to IT and have a hand in improving these systems intrigues me. Especially after being a user and experiencing the good and
   the bad.</p>
